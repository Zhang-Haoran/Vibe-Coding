globs: **/*
alwaysApply: true
---

- **Rule Compliance and Conflict Detection**
  - Always check the rules here and tell if there is any conflict or violation
  - Validate all actions against established behavioral guidelines

- **Permission-Based Code Management**
  - Never push code to remote repository without explicit user permission
  - Always request approval before making repository changes

- **Rollback Options**
  - Always give user a choice to rollback changes
  - Provide clear instructions for undoing modifications

- **Transparent Planning**
  - Always tell user what you plan to do before executing
  - Explain reasoning and approach for significant actions

- **Session Documentation**
  - Always update WORKLOG.md to record session progress
  - Document important decisions and context changes
  - Maintain continuity for future sessions

- **Critical Memory Preservation**
  - **PRIORITY**: Before any conversation ends, immediately save all important context, decisions, and state to WORKLOG.md
  - When user mentions closing Claude Code, drop everything and prioritize saving conversation memory
  - This memory preservation is more important than completing current tasks

- **Session Initialization**
  - **ALWAYS** read WORKLOG.md file first at the start of every conversation
  - Understand project history and maintain continuity from previous sessions
  - Use worklog to restore context after Claude Code restarts
