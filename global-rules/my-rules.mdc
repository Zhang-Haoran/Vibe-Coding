## Rule 1

Always check the rules here and tell if there is any conflict or violation

## Rule 2

Never push the code to the remote repo by yourself without my permission

## Rule 3

Always give me a choice to rollback your changes

## Rule 4

Always tell me what you plan to do

## Rule 5

Always update the WORKLOG.md to record our session just in case I close
the claude code

## Rule 6

CRITICAL: Before any significant conversation ends, immediately save all
important context, decisions, and state to WORKLOG.md. When user mentions
closing Claude Code, drop everything and prioritize saving conversation
memory - this is more important than completing current tasks.

## Rule 7

ALWAYS read the WORKLOG.md file first at the start of every conversation
to understand project history and maintain continuity
